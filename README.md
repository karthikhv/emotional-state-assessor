I understand you want the Emotional State Assessor app to be publicly accessible. Since you’ve already pushed your code to GitHub and resolved the earlier merge issues, I’ll guide you on how to ensure your repository and deployed app are public, allowing anyone to access and use it. I’ll also address the README.md you requested, ensuring it reflects the public nature of your project.

Step 1: Make Your GitHub Repository Public
Your code is on GitHub at https://github.com/karthikhv/emotional-state-assessor. Let’s ensure the repository is public so anyone can view and clone it.

Check Repository Visibility:
Go to https://github.com/karthikhv/emotional-state-assessor.
If you see a "Public" label under the repository name, it’s already public. If it says "Private," proceed to the next step.
Change Repository to Public:
On the repository page, click Settings (near the top right).
Scroll to the bottom to the Danger Zone section.
Find the option Change repository visibility.
Click Change to public.
Confirm the change by typing your repository name and clicking I understand, change the visibility.
The repository is now public, and anyone can access it.
Verify:
Open https://github.com/karthikhv/emotional-state-assessor in a private/incognito browser window to confirm it’s accessible without logging in.
Step 2: Deploy the App on Streamlit Cloud (Publicly Accessible)
Since your app is a Streamlit app, deploying it on Streamlit Cloud is the easiest way to make it publicly accessible. Streamlit Cloud apps are public by default in the free tier, which aligns with your goal.

Log in to Streamlit Cloud:
Go to Streamlit Cloud.
Log in with your GitHub account (you may need to authorize Streamlit Cloud to access your repositories).
Create a New App:
Click New App > From GitHub Repository.
Select karthikhv/emotional-state-assessor from the list of repositories.
Set the main file to streamlit_app.py.
Click Deploy.
Wait for Deployment:
Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies from requirements.txt and deploy your app.
Once deployed, you’ll get a public URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.streamlit.app).
Verify Public Access:
Open the URL in a private/incognito window to confirm it’s accessible without logging in.
The app should display the "Emotional State Assessor" title, instructions, and the first question (e.g., "Question 1 of 10").
Step 3: Update Your README for Public Use
Since the app is for public use, let’s update the README.md to reflect that and include the deployed URL (once you have it). Below is an updated version of the README.md:

# Emotional State Assessor

Welcome to the **Emotional State Assessor**, a publicly accessible web-based application built with Streamlit that uses a machine learning model to assess your emotional state. Answer 10 simple questions to get an assessment of your mood and well-being.

## Live Demo
Try the app here: [Emotional State Assessor on Streamlit Cloud](https://your-app-name.streamlit.app)  
*(Replace the URL with the actual deployed URL after deployment)*

## Overview
The Emotional State Assessor asks you 10 questions about your mood, anxiety, sleep, appetite, and other factors over the past two weeks. It then uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict your emotional state (e.g., Happy, Normal, Sad) and provides a basic assessment.

## Features
- Interactive question-by-question interface.
- Machine learning-based emotional state prediction.
- User-friendly design with navigation buttons (Previous, Next, Assess My Emotion).
- Publicly accessible for anyone to use.
- Disclaimer to encourage professional consultation if needed.

## How to Use
1. Visit the [live demo](https://your-app-name.streamlit.app).
2. Answer the 10 questions one by one by selecting options.
3. Use the "Next" button to proceed or "Previous" to go back.
4. After answering all questions, click "Assess My Emotion" to see your predicted emotional state.
5. Click "Start New Assessment" to begin again.

## Run Locally (Optional)
If you’d like to run the app locally or contribute:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthikhv/emotional-state-assessor.git
   cd emotional-state-assessor
Install Dependencies:

#### Add the Updated README
1. **Save the README**:
   - Copy the above content into a file named `README.md` in your project directory (`C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\dA\Emotional State Assessor`).
   - If `README.md` already exists (from a previous `git pull`), overwrite it or merge the changes.

2. **Add, Commit, and Push**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\dA\Emotional State Assessor
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update README for public access"
   git push origin main
If the push fails due to a merge conflict (e.g., from the remote README), resolve it:
powershell

Copy
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts in README.md if needed
git add README.md
git commit -m "Merge README changes"
git push origin main
Add the Deployed URL:
After deploying on Streamlit Cloud, replace https://your-app-name.streamlit.app in the README with the actual URL.
Commit and push the updated README again.
Step 4: Handle Potential Issues
Large Files: If emotion_model.pkl or label_encoder.pkl exceeds GitHub’s 100MB limit, use Git LFS:
powershell

Copy
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pkl"
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with LFS"
git push origin main
Streamlit Cloud Deployment Errors:
Check the deployment logs in Streamlit Cloud for issues (e.g., missing files, dependency errors).
Ensure requirements.txt includes all necessary packages.
Public Access Confirmation: Test the deployed URL in a private/incognito window to confirm it’s publicly accessible.
Final Notes
Your app is now publicly accessible via the Streamlit Cloud URL.
The GitHub repository is public, allowing others to view, clone, and contribute.
The updated README.md provides clear instructions for public use, including a link to the live app.
